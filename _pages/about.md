Hey I’m Ant, a professional game developer currently working at [Mediatonic](https://www.mediatonicgames.com/) / Tonic Games Group in London, UK. I've released a handful of PC & console titles over the years including Sea of Thieves and Fall Guys. My expertise revolves around both environment art in both the technical implementation sense (tooling, pipeline, dev ops) and traditional environment art (level art, asset creation & lighting).

> I'm that middle man who sits on the art team who makes sure environments look good and are optimal...
