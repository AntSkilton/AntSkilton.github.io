Hey I’m Ant, a professional game developer currently working at [Mediatonic](https://www.mediatonicgames.com/) / Tonic Games Group in London, UK. I've released a handful of PC & console titles over the years including [Fall Guys](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/), [Sea of Thieves](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves/), [Strange Brigade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312670/Strange_Brigade/) & [Motorsport Manager](https://store.steampowered.com/app/415200/Motorsport_Manager/).

My expertise revolves around both environment art in both the technical implementation sense (tooling, pipeline, dev ops) and traditional environment art (level art, asset creation & lighting).
