Hey Iâ€™m Ant, a professional game developer currently working at [Mediatonic](https://www.mediatonicgames.com/) / Tonic Games Group. I've released a handful of PC & console titles over the years with my expertise revolving around technical and traditional environment art, art tooling and content pipeline.

Problem solving smart & creative implementations for creating captivating worlds is my bread and butter.
