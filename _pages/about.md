Hey I’m Ant, a professional game developer based in London, UK. I've contributed to a handful of PC & console titles over the years including [Fall Guys](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/), [Sea of Thieves](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves/), [Strange Brigade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312670/Strange_Brigade/) & [Motorsport Manager](https://store.steampowered.com/app/415200/Motorsport_Manager/).

My expertise revolves around technical art including areas such as pipeline, tooling, procedural materials and shaders. I've grown from a solid foundation of environment art in my career in which I've naturally grown towards being a TA.
