## Storytelling & Characters

> Utterly enjoyable. There you go, review done. Oh, you want more information into why I think it's so good?... Well, for a friend like you, go on then...

My dowdy self quote above there is as casual as the dialogue you'll see between the protagonist [Zag](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Zagreus) and the other characters in the game (save a select few such as [Nyx](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Nyx)), for the most part being companions or family members. When combined with the voice acting, the dialogue evolves to have a present day tone and I even found myself chuckling once or twice. The modernist pally family attitudes of the uncles, aunts, cousins and nephews complements the (seemingly mostly) British voice acting within the game, particularly Zag himself.

In Greek mythology, all of these gods are almost silent forces of inhumane elements of power, yet the pleasant juxtaposition of giving them all a first hand contact point removes the veil of mystery in an entertaining way as if you were watching the family of gods and goddesses communicate on Gogglebox *(a British TV show about families with mildly interesting, yet usually mundane banter as they watch even more mundane TV).*

The chirpiness of the characters (all save Hades himself - which his bitterness fittingly adds to his uniqueness) set the tone of the game for if a blind person were to listen to them all interact, they feel the light heartedness of the situation. Even [Cerberus](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Cerberus), the family dog who you adore and never fear, where despite the 3 headed *cute* beast is blocking the exit to Hell itself you fittingly never contest with and get his some food to distract him. Even death, the grim reaper personified as [Thanatos](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Thanatos) is your old mate.

This is the right move, particularly for a stylised game, but also due to how technically there's only enough substance to support the end goal, which is reach Olympus and find Mum because Dad lied to you about her existence. Short and not so sweet. This is a roguelike not an embodied RPG, and the narrator wisps are there for additional flavour throughout the environments should the player choose to listen for a moment.

The game chooses it's time in dialogue appropriately respecting the player's time. Arguably the most encountered NPC in the game is [Charon](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Charon), who is the muted groaning shopkeeper. It could've been so easy for the devs to add waffle flavour text to him about each biome he appears in, and I'm glad they didn't. I'd like to highlight the first boss's narrative choice as I believe it's a smart design. You meet [Meg](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Charon), one of the 3 Fury Sisters *(which inadvertedly has a tone of the [Poe Sisters in Ocarina of Time](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Poe_Sisters_(Ocarina_of_Time)) about it)*, for whom you can get to meet after defeating Meg. Similar to Charon, [Alecto](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Alecto) and especially [Tisiphone](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Tisiphone) aren't as fleshed out narratively as Meg but their existence is warranted with recycled and modified mechanics from other enemies to support replayability as you'll never encounter a boss fight as frequently as the first one. They're also never allowed in the House of Hades, yes they're that mental even the God of the Dead doesn't want them knocking about, it makes sense from a production point of view to cut their presence.

Something I thought was mildy interesting is that in the late game with enough nectar gifted, you can form romantic relationships with select characters from both genders, so you in theory have the reaper of death himself, Than, be your boyfriend.

## Resource Management

when you collect hleath it feels valuable and ou cant buy it too much.

## Level Design

At a healthy 11.38GB, as a predominantly flat shaded game (save for characters), working with a dimetric camera makes sense for tile reusability and has proved Supergiant success in the past with Transistor. Below is an image of the bones with repeating sprites as highlighted. The layering of sprites is complex enough to appear bespoke, with lighting and parallax silhouette layers of candles and pillars to break potential points of visual repetition. Life is easier when  working with a perpetual camera angle.

Within the gameplay space you'll only find interactables, walls, traps or negative spaces such as pits or lava. You're introduced to all concepts the game mechanics has to offer in the first biome in a fairly distanced manner. In the second biome the focus is on valid floor space, where lava will cause environmental damage. This is tested and mastered with the boss as he has 5 additional snake heads with very small pockets of space to briefly breathe in before you move onto the next one (with AoE bombarding you on top). The third biome densely packs traps which tests your ability to juggle multiple timings of microtasks (enforced with enemy self-revival if you don't properly kill them). Other enemy type combinations such as suicidal chariots make this ever more tricky. The trials of the fourth biome are brief but are packed into a series of very small rooms. This is a good way to force players into close quarters and manipulate their behaviour on what are mostly vermin and satyr cultists. Enough to wear you down before Hades substantially if you don't adapt your play style.

The character controller never feels frustrating when dashing due to the ghost mechanic of passing through any obstacle providing that the ending dash location is habitable space. With predictable enemy behaviour and clear attack cycles (with time as roguelikes require) your ability to dodge and wear down a room presents a challenge, which never makes you feel as if the game has robbed you due to some small tolerance not in your favour.

## Visual Design

My very initial impressions of the art style were a little sloppy with any colour being available to use in the colour gamut. After experiencing and soaking in the game for some time I changed my mind. I simply hadn't been exposed to this particular style for some time, and naturally I was sceptical of anything new as we do in psychology, hence why trends in fashion from clothes, media and food exist to appeal to the established market.

However, this style is used in eastern art where black is embraced as a hard shadow in addition to the typical outlining use case in western art. [Here're](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/File:OoT_Baby_Dodongo_Artwork.png) [some](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/File:MM_Deku_Butler_Artwork.png) [examples](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/File:MM_Goron_Link_Artwork.png). Grey doesn't exist, as if a comic line artists handed over inked copies art to digital colourists to fill in. When you need to pair a game as metal as hell, gods and family feuds, with gameplay of a hardcore roguelike, knowing it's stylised to compliment the contemporary theme, this becomes a fine choice.

Each biome has a distinct palette and theme from starting at home with the crypts of [Tartarus](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Tartarus), into the belly of hell with lava in [Asphodel](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Asphodel), then into the gardens of [Elysium](https://hades.gamepedia.com/Elysium) of where noble souls of hell live craving more death in a Roman like amphitheatre. The journey physically makes sense all connected by the River Styx. As you approach closer to the mortal realm you begin to see the cogs and machines which keep hell ticking, with richer metallic materials and reflections with grandeur, purple and gold complimentaries.

Which segues nicely into the use of colour which certainly isn't a subdued palette, featuring chaotic flecks of random colour which are so vivid that they wouldn't usually belong in the comp (as highlighted in the image above). The colour theory doesn't clash to be deemed artistically incorrect. Fundamentals are still in place such as the backgrounds being lighter and desaturated with interactables, enemies and characters having the most saturation. The heavy use of black acts as a stylistic warden allowing the contentious vividity of the game to exist, for without it, it'd be noisy fighting for the attention of the viewer as the inmates clash with everything on the screen. Due to the scale spacing of the vast environments to everything else, readability even in the deepest and most chaotic of combat, the inmates are still kept in line.

The environments follow an austere complementary schema such as Elysium here using red for key elements. Usually dappled light has a general noise and lights the character dynamically as they pass through it. With the vast majority of lighting, it follows a harsh lined ruled of implying  the shading, with light having a dodge tool feel, increasing saturation rather than revealing more of the albedo to the material. This vividity technique is used frequently in stylised games with no direct metric or connection to reality.

![Alt](\assets\images\2021-01-17-hades-game-review\styxChamber.png)

What also works well is that in this Temple of Styx chamber the lighting has gone from a beige to a burnt orange, with no concern for HDR or or overexposure. Forms wise, having enormous thrones, chunky pillars and floor patterns compliment the modularity of the tileset, with no care for any detail smaller than a fist.

This hard edged rule follows true for VFX too, with linear smoke trails on candles (with an element of jagged chaos), embodied with a jelly-wave based hard heptagonal shape, subliminally supporting 777, instability and other hellish concepts. Nice to see a vertical gradient used here to imply the attenuation.

![Alt](\assets\images\2021-01-17-hades-game-review\eurydice.png){: .align-center}

The character portraits are gorgeous pieces of art that would work great as duochromatic inked pieces too I reckon. Here, Eurydice has a large ration of her skin and canopy covered with muted greens, with yellows to assist and imply autumn, with orange-reds being reserved for tertiary highlights such as earrings, tattoos and her acorn. Slight chaos like the environments of purples and blues on her accessories tell me that this is a Hades piece of art. Usually when you see a non block colour filling which isn't a shadow and implies a highlight such as the teal silver laurel strip on her abdomen, or the golden UI frame on the right of the shot, is when the artist wants you communicate that the material is a metal. Highlights are used sparingly as it's easy to detract from their quality when overused and creates unwarranted noise.

## Audio

You can tell when a studio has hired an experienced musician who understands the requirements that the game needs to emote and can expend the resources to make it happen. Naturally, the [final boss fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVukkhUI-xM&ab_channel=SupergiantGames) has to have a metal soundtrack (with a phase 2 mode to it), with NPC interludes having their own themes fittingly well too, feeling the raw fingers slide along the strings of a guitar knowing it's not a computerised reconstruction. I've praised the voice acting a lot, but as voice over work is often left until latter phases of the project, the script writers had the right amount of content to get through enough runs without repeated voice lines after 16 hours of gameplay, and without it feeling like an artificial afterthought.
